# Gardener-Game
My first game with p5.js

Trying to create a game where plants grow and the player ("gardener") has to cut them down before they reach the top of the screen.

Initially, I want one plant and then a second plant to be added when the player's score equals 10 and then a third at 20 etc.

Possible additional funcitonality: score streak bonus, powerups, plants which require more than one click (tree), plants that you don't want to click, insects (good and bad), eventually new levels (different backgrounds and plant types), convert plant rectangles into images, animate background and plants, possibly change to a cut rather than click like fruit ninja, code for mobile compatability.
